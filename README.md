# Etch-a-Sketch Project

This project builds an etch-a-sketch that can be painted using your mouse and cleared/resized by pressing buttons.

This is a project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project).

## Pre-Project Thoughts

I am doing this project after having gone significantly forward in the curriculum.

They recently added the JS101 section with a revamped version of this project.

I plan on using CSS Grid for the first time this time.
The last time I did this project can be found [here](https://github.com/JonathanYiv/sketchpad).

This time I have a much stronger understanding of JavaScript and programming in general.
